# 8_Ball_Lifeguard
A Repository for an Augmented Reality based real time 8 ball pool helper 

This is a Project made by 
Devank Agarwal <devanka@alumni.cmu.edu>
Jimmy Ray <jwray@alumni.cmu.edu>
Justin Rager <jrager@almuni.cmu.edu>

as part of the ECE Casptone Requirement for the Bachelors of Science in 
Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. 

This was completed in the months of January 2023 to May 2023 and involves
a physical frame, the desciption of which can be seen on our webiste: 
http://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ece500/projects/s23-teamc7/

This would also be the best resource to see how the project was madeand the 
biggest challenges we face since each tember posted weekly status updates 
alongside thier git commits. 


During the completion of this project we won the award for the most engaging 
project at the Techspark Engineering Expo 2023 held at Carnegie Mellon 
University to showcase various capstone projects across the various fields of 
engineering offered at Carnegie Mellon University. 

To run this project, one would need to run the arduino script on the arduino on
the cue stick for the cue system which is available in 

Capstone_Cue.ino

alongside the arduino script for the frame to control the game state in 

Servo_buttons/Servo_buttons.ino

After the setup has code has been run and the projector and camera have been
aligned, to run the main system, one would run

pool_ball_rec_2.py

which interacts with the rest of the codebase. 

Proper Allignment of the projector and the camera must be done by the files 

allign_camera.py
and 
projector_allign.py


We have inlcuded a bunch of png and jpeg files for one to see as they might
help one understand the system better.
